# Fencing Elo Ratings
This repository contains code for assigning and updating Elo ratings to foil fencers based on international competitions (excluding the World Championship). <br> 
<br>
Elo ratings increase based soley on amount of "wins" and the rating of opponents.
The amount of points a fencer scored in a match was used as their amount of "wins" against their opponent. <br>
<br>
The competitions chosen (in the foil_competitions file) were all within the 2017-2020 seasons in an effort to rank foil fencers for the upcoming Tokyo olympics.
