# Fencing Elo Ratings
This repository contains code for assigning and updating Elo ratings to foil fencers based on international competitions (excluding the World Championship). <br> 
<br>
Elo ratings increase based on the amount of "wins" and the rating of opponents. In this project ratings are updated between each match, not each competition. <br>
The amount of points a fencer scored in a match against a given opponent was used as their amount of "wins" against that opponent for the ratings update. <br>
<br>
The competitions chosen (in the foil_competitions file) were all within the 2017-2020 seasons in an effort to rank foil fencers for the upcoming Tokyo olympics.
